  summary: "Estimation of cell type proportions per spot in 2D space from spatial\
    \ transcriptomic data coupled with corresponding single-cell data"
  description: "Spatial decomposition (also often referred to as Spatial deconvolution)\
    \ is applicable to spatial transcriptomics data where the transcription profile\
    \ of each capture location (spot, voxel, bead, etc.) do not share a bijective\
    \ relationship with the cells in the tissue, i.e., multiple cells may contribute\
    \ to the same capture location. The task of spatial decomposition then refers\
    \ to estimating the composition of cell types/states that are present at each\
    \ capture location. The cell type/states estimates are presented as proportion\
    \ values, representing the proportion of the cells at each capture location that\
    \ belong to a given cell type.\n\nWe distinguish between _reference-based_ decomposition\
    \ and _de novo_ decomposition, where the former leverage external data (e.g.,\
    \ scRNA-seq or scNuc-seq) to guide the inference process, while the latter only\
    \ work with the spatial data. We require that all datasets have an associated\
    \ reference single cell data set, but methods are free to ignore this information.\
    \ \n\nDue to the lack of real datasets with the necessary ground-truth, this task\
    \ makes use of a simulated dataset generated by creating cell-aggregates by sampling\
    \ from a Dirichlet distribution. The ground-truth dataset consists of the spatial\
    \ expression matrix, XY coordinates of the spots, true cell-type proportions for\
    \ each spot, and the reference single-cell data (from which cell aggregated were\
    \ simulated).\n"
